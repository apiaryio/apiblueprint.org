## Getting Help

### Slack

We run our own [API Blueprint Slack channel](https://apiblueprint-slack.herokuapp.com/)
where you can ask questions and discuss the language.

### Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a great way to ask questions, you can use the
[apiblueprint](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/apiblueprint) tag.

### Reporting Bugs

If you've encountered a bug in our API Blueprint parser Drafter you can report
it in our [GitHub issue tracker for Drafter](http://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues).

Please search existing issues beforehand to see if the problem is already known.

When filing a new bug please include the following:

- An concise description of the problem. If the issue is a crash, please
  include the stack trace.
- An example blueprint which can reproduce a parsing issue.

## Contributing

We welcome any contributions to the language or parsers, please get in touch
with us on Slack if you're looking for any guidance.

### API Blueprint Request for Comments

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow directly
to the [API Blueprint Language](http://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint).

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the API Blueprint team.

The ["RFC" (request for comments)](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint-rfcs)
process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new
features to enter the language.
